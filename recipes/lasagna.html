    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <h2>How to?</h2>
        <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong></li> 
        <p >This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</p>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong></li>
        <p>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</p>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong></li>
        <p>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</p>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong></li>
        <p>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</p>
        <li><Strong>Spices and seasoning:</Strong></li>
        <p>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</p>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong></li>
        <p>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</p>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong></li>
        <p>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</p>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong></li>
        <p>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to layer lasagna</h2>
    <p>The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:</p>

        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>How long to cook lasagna</h1>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. </p>
        <p>Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. </p>
